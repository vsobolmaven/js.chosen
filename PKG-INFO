        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Chosen`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Chosen`: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.chosen``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``chosen_jquery`` from ``js.chosen`` and ``need`` it where you
        want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.chosen import chosen_jquery
          >>> chosen_jquery.need()
